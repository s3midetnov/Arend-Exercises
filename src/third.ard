{-Exercise 1: Implement the function lookup, which takes a list xs and a natural number n
and returns the n-th element in the list. The function should also take a proof that n is in the right range:
 T (n < length xs).-}

\func lookup {A : \Type} (xs : List A) (n : Nat) (p : T (n < length sx)) : A \elim n
