{-Exercise 1: Let f : A -> B and g : B -> C be some functions.
 Prove that if f and g are injective, then g o f is also injective.
 Prove that if g o f is injective, then f is also injective.-}

\func Injective (A B : \Type) (f : A -> B) : \Type => \Pi (x y : A) -> f x = f y -> x = y

\func \infix 7 ee {A B C : \Type} (f : A -> B) (g : B -> C) : A -> C =>
  \lam a => g (f a)
